This is a non-recursive make build system that supports large and deeply nested
source trees. Adding sub directories to the build is trivial and requires a
minimal make file. With a mindful layout of the source files, make is able to be
run from any sub directory within the source tree and the build system will only
compile the sources found in and below the current working directory.

The build system also has verbosity control on the build. Add "V=1" to the
make command to get a full output of the commands being called to build.

There are a few potential drawbacks such as not being able to have different
files in the source tree with the same name.
